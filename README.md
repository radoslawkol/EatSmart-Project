# EatSmart Project
### Website created for purpose of participating in Zwolnieni z Teorii
Zwolnieni z Teorii is an internet platform created by Zwolnieni z Teorii Foundation (aka. ZWZT), the largest educational foundation in Poland.

## Story
The purpose of project was to encourage people to eat healthy. We worked with team running social media. I created this page to display our recipes. 
Creating this page was a great experience for me, beacause I learnt Node.js and Express. I created my small API with recipes and articles. Moreover it was my first production website, which was a breakthrough moment in my learning process.
